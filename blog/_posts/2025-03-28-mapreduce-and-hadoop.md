Finally understood the mechanics of mapreduce today. I should say yesterday since it's past 12 now.

Conceptually, it's just a form of parellization. I had to repeatedly remind myself that this is one of the fundamental frameworks that led to the rapid scaling of giant services like Google Search. Also, I have no idea how there are much, much more nuances than just a few slides of explanations.

Maybe I should just try it out and feel the pain myself. Or hope the day I need to use it won't come. Either way I should appreciate these frameworks more.

More references I should probably read:
- Apache's Hadoop tutorial [hadoop.apache.org](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/mapred_tutorial.html)
- IBM's explanation of Map Reduce [www.ibm.com](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/mapreduce)
- GeeksforGeeks' example [www.geeksforgeeks.org](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mapreduce-understanding-with-real-life-example/)
