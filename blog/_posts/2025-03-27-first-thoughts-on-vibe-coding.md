First impression: What kind of mess is this.

Although unexperienced and wrote tons of messy code, I thought the idea of generating whatever by a model was crazy.

However, it can also be a great tool if properly used. The idea of realizing an concept as quick as possible can be helpful. I should probably look into and learn more about prototyping, which feels extremely similar to vibe coding in my opinion.

Planning to take a look at [this DeepLearning.AI course](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/vibe-coding-101-with-replit) tomorrow or in the near future.

Learn to harness the craziness or be left behind, I guess.
